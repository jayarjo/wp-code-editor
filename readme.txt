Adds proper code editor to all code editing textareas, including the Text tab of post edit screens

== Description ==

It has been a pain to edit plugin and theme files from the WordPress backend for a while already. Actually I doubt that anyone ever considered this part of WordPress seriously at all. It looks awfull and is barely usable, especially comparing to the other parts of the platform and the progress that they've made in recent years. 

WP Code Editor adds [code editor](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about) to all the code editing screens, including the Text tab on posts edit pages.
